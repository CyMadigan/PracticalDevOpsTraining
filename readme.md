# Practical DevOps Training

## Introduction

The original GitHub repository and its content has been created for the training "Practical DevOps". Its content is described below. All scheduled trainings take place all over Western Europe in spring 2016. Note that the content of the repository will not be kept up to date after all the trainings took place.

The specific training materials for this workshop have been created by Rainer Stropek on request by Microsoft. This adapted version for the training delivery in Belgium is a fork based on [https://github.com/rstropek/PracticalDevOpsTraining].

Note that this training is a practical (Microsoft) DevOps training and will guide attendees how to make use of DevOps principles in the full software development application lifecycle. Don't expect to learn the ins and outs of a new language/framework, but be ready to absorb the culture that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.

## Slides and Exercises

For this training I will use a custom powerpoint slidedeck which will be shared after the training course.

**Note that you can view the original slides online at [http://rstropek.github.io/PracticalDevOpsTraining/](http://rstropek.github.io/PracticalDevOpsTraining/)**.

**You can find the exercises of the training in the [Exercises](Exercises) folder.**

### Prerequisites

You will need your own laptop to do the hands-on labs. Ideally, you have the latest version of Visual Studio installed and you have access to your own Microsoft Azure subscription. In case you don't have a valid Azure Subscription, we will try to provide some free temporary Azure passes.

* Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise (Update 2) - trial available via [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx]
* Node.js with NPM - download via [https://nodejs.org/en/]
* Git for Windows - download via [https://git-scm.com/downloads]
* Azure SDK for VS 2015 - download via [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/]
* Azure PowerShell - download via [http://aka.ms/webpi-azps/]
* PuTTY - download via [http://www.putty.org/]
* ASP.NET CDore 1.0 RC2 [https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows]
* Optional: VS 2015 Tools for Docker (Preview) - download via [https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0f5b2caa-ea00-41c8-b8a2-058c7da0b3e4]
* Optional: Docker Toolbox - download via [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox]

Attendees will be working together in groups of 3 people for the exercises. A shared Visual Studio Team Services account will be used with a dedicated Team Project for each team. Instructions will be given during the course. 

## Training Content

Agile Software Engineering with Visual Studio (Team Services), Microsoft Azure & Open Source tools

Software engineering practices have changed drastically in the last few years. Agile practices, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Open Source and similar developments have proven their effectiveness. Microsoft’s platforms for software development and cloud computing have also embraced these concepts and are at the leading edge in their domain.

In this **two-day training** you will learn how software development works with Microsoft’s tools and languages. Based on a consistent sample, you will learn how to

* setup a modern development environment with the latest version of **Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team Services**,
* understand the importance of a consistent version control branch plan for all your applications
* develop a cross-platform **RESTful web API with C# and ASP.NET Core**,
* benefit from the latest developments in the Visual Studio C# IDE,
* integrate modern front-end development frameworks and languages like **Angular 2 and TypeScript** in Visual Studio,
* use **cross-platform build- and test-automation tools** to automate your build- and quality assurance processes,
* create highly available and secure environments for your web APIs and web applications in **Microsoft Azure with Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**,
* setup a multi-stage (dev/test/prod) environment in **Azure App Services**,
* learn about the advantages of the upcoming container technology **Docker** and
* automate deployment to Microsoft Azure with **Visual Studio Release Management**.

### Training Structure

The training is a combination of approx. 60% presentations with embedded demos and 40% hands-on time where you have your fingers on the keyboard and try what you have learned. Those who are new to the topics can follow a provided hands-on lab guide step by step. In areas you are already familiar with, you can put the guides to the side and create an individual sample with the latest tools and technologies.

Attendees should already have basic knowledge about Visual Studio, .NET, C#, HTML and JavaScript. Detailed knowledge about the latest versions of these tools, frameworks and languages is not required.
