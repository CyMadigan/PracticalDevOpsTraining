# Exercise 5


## Learnings

1. Creating App Services Web Apps
1. Publish web apps manuall from Visual Studio
1. Basic configuration (here: enable remote debugging) of web apps
1. Connecting to Azure using Visual Studio Server Explorer
1. Remote debugging of web apps


## Add Web App

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in.

1. Add *Web App* named `PracticalDevOps-Dev` (you might have to replace this with another name if it has already been taken) to the resource group `PracticalDevOps-Dev`. Make sure that the App Service plan is in the same Data Center Region as your storage account.<br/>

1. Look for telemetry from your deployed application in Application Insights.


## Update and Run Web Test

1. Open the web test created in [exercise 3](exercise03.md).

1. Change web server to deployment in the cloud.<br/>

1. Run web test to see if it succeeds for deployed version.

1. Open the load test created in [exercise 3](exercise03.md).

1. Run load test to see performance for deployed version.


## Remote Debugging

1. Enable remote debugging for your web app in the Azure portal.<br/>
   ![Enable Remote Debugging](img/enable-remote-debugging.png)

1. Open `Controllers/BooksController.cs` and set a breakpoint (F9) to the first line of the `Get` method. This operation may take a few moments.

1. Open `http://practicaldevops-dev.azurewebsites.net/api/books` in a browser and note how you can debug the deployed version of your web app with your local Visual Studio.
